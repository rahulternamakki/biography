            Sindhu broke into the top 20 of the BWF World Rankings in September 2012, at the Age of 17.[8] She has won a total of Five medals at the BWF World Championships and is just the second woman after China's Zhang Ning ever to win five or more singles medals in the competition.

        <h2>Early life and training</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            Pusarla Venkata Sindhu was born and brought up in Hyderabad, India to P. V. Ramana and P. Vijaya.[4][16] Ramana, an employee of the Indian Railways, was born in Nirmal, Telangana while Vijaya hails from Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh.[17] Both her parents have been national level volleyball players. Her father, Ramana, who was a member of the Indian volleyball team that won the bronze medal in the 1986 Seoul Asian Games, received the Arjuna Award in 2000 for his contribution to the sport.<br><br>
            Sindhu lives in Hyderabad. She was educated at Auxilium High School[19] and at St. Ann's College for Women, Hyderabad.[20] Though her parents played professional volleyball, she chose badminton over it because she drew inspiration from the success of Pullela Gopichand, the 2001 All England Open Badminton Champion.[21] She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight.[18] She first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of the Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy.[21] While profiling her career, a correspondent with The Hindu wrote:<br>
            "The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, traveling a distance of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment."<br><br>
            Gopichand seconded this correspondent's opinion when he said that "the most striking feature in Sindhu's game is her attitude and the never-say-die spirit."[22] After joining Gopichand's badminton academy, Sindhu won several titles. In the under-10 years category, she won the fifth Servo All India ranking championship in the doubles category and the singles title at the Ambuja Cement All India ranking. In the under-13 years category, she won the singles title at the Sub-juniors in Pondicherry, doubles titles at the Krishna Khaitan All India Tournament IOC All India Ranking, the Sub-Junior Nationals and the All India Ranking in Pune. She also won the under-14 team gold medal at the 51st National State Games in India.[18] She later parted company with Gopichand and went on to train with South Korean coach Park Tae-sang.<br><br>

She then downed the defending champion, second-seeded Wang Yihan of China, 21–18, 23–21 to enter the quarterfinals.[43] She set up a meeting with another higher-seeded Chinese player, Wang Shixian, and beat her 21–18, 21–17 to become only India's second medalist in the singles events at the World Championships since Prakash Padukone's bronze medal in 1983.[44] However, she lost in the semi-final to eventual champion Ratchanok Intanon.<br><br>

            Sindhu was on the verge of victory against Li Xuerui in the quarterfinals of the Asian Championships, but ended up losing 21–11, 19–21, 8–21, narrowly missing out on a second consecutive Asian Championships medal.[54] At the 2015 World Championships, where she was seeded eleventh, Sindhu defeated Line Højmark Kjærsfeldt of Denmark in the first round after being a game down. She then stunned third seeded Li Xuerui in the Round of 16 and reached the quarterfinals of the World Championships once again.[55] However, this time, she suffered defeat against her Korean opponent Sung Ji-hyun in a close quarterfinal match 21–17, 19–21, 16–21, narrowly missing out on a third consecutive World Championship medal.<br><br>
            In October, playing at the Denmark Open, Sindhu reached her maiden superseries tournament final, defeating three seeded players – Tai Tzu-ying, Wang Yihan and Carolina Marín. In the final, she lost to the defending champion Li Xuerui in straight games 19–21, 12–21.[57] In November, the defending champion Sindhu won her third successive women's singles title at the Macau Open Grand Prix Gold after defeating Japan's Minatsu Mitani in the final 21–9, 21–23, 21–14.<br><br>

            She suffered a stress fracture in 2015 that kept her from playing for nearly six months, yet managed to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics.<br><br>
            In January, Sindhu won the Malaysia Masters Grand Prix Gold women's singles title after beating Scotland's Kirsty Gilmour in the final.[60] She had also won this tournament in 2013. She lost a close match at the Asian Championships to Tai Tzu-ying in the second round, in which she failed to capitalise on a match point and suffered defeat.[61] In the 2016 Premier Badminton League, she was the captain of the Chennai Smashers team. In the group stage of the league, she won all of her five matches to help her team qualify for the semi-final and win the tournament against Mumbai Rockets.<br><br>
            Sindhu was seeded ninth at the Rio Olympic Games. In the group stage, she defeated Hungary's Laura Sárosi (2–0) and Canada's Michelle Li (2–1).[62] She then ousted Taiwanese eighth seed Tai Tzu-ying (2–0) in the Round of 16[63] to meet the second seeded Wang Yihan from China in the quarterfinals, whom she also defeated in straight games.[64] She later faced sixth seeded Japanese star Nozomi Okuhara in the semi-finals and won in straight games, ensuring a podium finish.[65] This set the stage for her final showdown with the top seed from Spain, Carolina Marín.[66] Marin managed to beat her in three games in the 83-minute match.[67] With that result, she clinched the silver medal, creating history as India's youngest individual Olympic medallist and the first Indian woman to bag an Olympic silver medal. This was only the second instance of a podium finish at the Olympics by any Indian badminton player.<br><br>
            Following her Olympic success, Sindhu clinched the title at the Thaihot China Open beating China's Sun Yu 21–11, 17–21, 21–11.

With 2 wins in the group, she reached the semi-finals, managing to do so in just her first-ever appearance in the tournament. However, she was defeated in the semi-finals by Sung Ji-hyun, going down 15–21, 21–18, 15–21.[73] Sindhu was named as the BWF Most Improved Player of the Year following her achievements in 2016.<br><br>
            Sindhu won the Syed Modi International by beating Gregoria Mariska Tunjung of Indonesia in the final.[75] In the India Open Superseries, she won the title by defeating Carolina Marín in straight games.[76] In April 2017, she achieved a career-high world ranking of number 2.

Her final against Okuhara is widely regarded as one of the best ever women's singles matches in the history of the sport.<br><br>
            Sindhu defeated Okuhara in the final of the 2017 Korea Open Super Series 22–20, 11–21, 21–18, thereby becoming the first Indian to win the Korea Open.[79] In August, she took charge as the Deputy Collector in Krishna District in the Chief Commissioner of Land Administration (CCLA) office under the Revenue Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh.[80] She set up a repeat clash of the previous year's final at the Hongkong Open, which she again lost to Tai Tzu-ying in straight games.[81] Owing to her consistent performances, she qualified yet again for the Superseries Finals, and was also nominated for the BWF Female Player of the Year Award, which was eventually won by Chen Qingchen of China.[82] In the group stage of the Dubai World Superseries Finals, she won all of her matches against He Bingjiao (2–1), Sayaka Sato (2–0) and Akane Yamaguchi (2–0) to progress to the semi-final.

            Sindhu faltered in the final again, this time at her home event, the India Open, where she had a match point in the third game but was unable to convert it and lost the match narrowly to Beiwen Zhang.[85] At the All England Open Championships, she made it to the last four, before losing to world number 3 Akane Yamaguchi in the semi-final with a close 21–19, 19–21, 18–21 scoreline. This was her best performance at the All England Open.[86] She competed at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, winning a gold medal in the mixed team event[87] and a silver medal in the singles event.[88] Her jinx of losing in finals continued after she went down to Nozomi Okuhara in the final of the Thailand Open. <br><br>
            Sindhu was seeded third in the 2018 BWF World Championships. She won her opening encounters against Fitriani and ninth seed Sung Ji-hyun, both in straight games.

            Sindhu was bought by the defending champions Hyderabad Hunters in the 2018 PBL auctions and was named as their skipper.[96] They lost in the semi-finals to Mumbai Rockets.[97] Sindhu competed at the Indian National Badminton Championships where she reached the final, losing to three-time champion Saina Nehwal 18–21, 15–21.[98] Just before the All England Badminton Championships, she had ended her deal with Yonex and signed a mega-deal with Li-Ning for 4 years worth nearly ₹50 crore (US$6.3 million). This led to her having a new racket and equipment to which she had to get used to within 2–3 weeks, to debut it at the prestigious All England Badminton Championships.[99] She reached her first final of the season in the Indonesia Open, where she lost to Akane Yamaguchi of Japan 15–21, 16–21. <br><br>
            At the 2019 World Championships, Sindhu was seeded fifth. She opened her campaign with comfortable straight-game victories over Pai Yu-po and ninth seed Beiwen Zhang in successive rounds. She impressed everyone with her victory over second seed Tai Tzu-ying in the quarterfinals. She defeated Tai, coming from a game down 12–21, 23–21, 21–19 to make the semi-final and secure a fifth World Championship medal, the joint-most in the history of women's singles badminton.[101] In the semi-final, she defeated third seed Chen Yufei in straight games in dominating fashion, 21–7, 21–14, to enter her third consecutive World Championships final.[102] In the final against Nozomi Okuhara, she put up a near-flawless display to win 21–7, 21–7. In the process, she became the first Indian to win gold at the World Championships. <br><br>
            Despite her ranking as 15th on the World Tour, Sindhu got a wild card entry into the 2019 BWF World Tour Finals because of her World Championship victory in August 2019.[104] She competed in the World Tour Finals in Guangzhou as the defending champion but failed to reach the knockout phase after losing to Chen Yufei (1–2) and Akane Yamaguchi (1–2) in successive rounds.

            Sindhu, reaching her first final in over 18 months at the 2021 Swiss Open, suffered a demoralising defeat against Carolina Marín, losing 12–21, 5–21.[108] She was then stunned by Pornpawee Chochuwong of Thailand in the semi-final of the All England Open, losing out 17–21, 9–21.[109] In May, she was elected as one of the two ambassadors from badminton in the International Olympic Committee's campaign ‘Believe in Sport’, aimed at preventing competition manipulation in the sport.<br><br>
            Sindhu was seeded sixth at the Tokyo Olympic Games. She won both of her group matches against Israel's Ksenia Polikarpova[111] and Hong Kong's Cheung Ngan Yi[112] to progress towards the knockout stage. She defeated Denmark's Mia Blichfeldt comfortably in the Round of 16 and reached the quarterfinals.[113] She put up a dominating display to outmanoeuvre fourth seed Akane Yamaguchi of Japan 21–13, 22–20, placing herself in the last four stage, also becoming the only Indian shuttler to reach two consecutive Olympic semi-finals.[114] Her opponent for the semi-final was second seed Tai Tzu-ying. Sindhu, who was yet to drop a game in the tournament, fell against Taiwan's Tai in two straight games 18–21, 12–21.[115] She later beat eighth seed He Bingjiao of China in the playoff to clinch the bronze medal, thereby becoming the first Indian woman and only the fourth player in women's singles badminton to claim two medals at two consecutive Olympic games. <br><br>
            At the 2021 BWF World Championships, where she competed as the defending champion, Sindhu was seeded sixth. She eased past Slovakia's Martina Repiská in her opening encounter in straight games. She then defeated ninth seed Pornpawee Chochuwong 21–14, 21–18 in another straight-game encounter to make the quarterfinals.[117] However, in the quarterfinals, she went down to top seed Tai Tzu-ying 17–21, 13–21, failing to medal at the World Championships for only the second time in her career. <br><br>
            Sindhu qualified for the 2021 BWF World Tour Finals at the end of the year. In the group stage, she beat Line Christophersen (2–0), Yvonne Li (2–0) and lost to Pornpawee Chochuwong (1–2), qualifying for the semi-finals as second in her group. In the semi-final, she beat Akane Yamaguchi 21–15, 15–21, 21–19 in an exciting clash to make a third final at the year-end championships, only the second women's singles player to do so. In the final, she lost to South Korea's An Se-young to bag a second silver medal at the tournament. <br><br>
            Sindhu won the Syed Modi International for the second time beating compatriot Malvika Bansod in the final.[120] She then won the title at the 2022 Swiss Open, defeating Thailand's Busanan Ongbamrungphan in the final in two straight games.[121] At the 2022 Badminton Asia Championships, where she was seeded fourth, Sindhu defeated fifth seed He Bingjiao of China in the quarterfinals,[122] but lost a close and controversial semi-final to top seed Akane Yamaguchi,[123] thus winning the bronze medal, her second medal at the tournament.[124] She then won the Singapore Open title, beating Asian Champion Wang Zhiyi of China in the final. <br><br>
            At the 2022 Commonwealth Games, Sindhu won her maiden Commonwealth Games gold medal in the women's singles, beating Michelle Li of Canada in the final. With this win, she became only the second women's singles player to win a full set of medals at the Commonwealth Games.[126] She was also unbeaten in the mixed team event, where India won a silver medal.[127] However, during the Games, she sustained a left foot stress fracture injury that kept her out of all remaining tournaments of the year, including the World Championships[128] and the World Tour Finals.<br><br>
            Sindhu made a return from her injury layoff in the first tournament of 2023, the Malaysia Open.[130] In February, she was part of the Indian team that won a bronze medal at the Badminton Asia Mixed Team Championships, India's first-ever medal at the tournament.[131] She reached her first final of the season at the 2023 Spain Masters, where she lost to Gregoria Mariska Tunjung in straight games.<br><br>
