        <h2>Debut, breakthrough and critical acclaim (2010–2012)</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            Samantha began her professional film career with Gautham Vasudev Menon's Telugu film, Ye Maaya Chesave (2010). The film, simultaneously made in Tamil as Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010), was highly anticipated prior to release, primarily due to the first time collaboration between Gautham Menon and composer A. R. Rahman.[9] The actress successfully auditioned and was signed up for the project in August 2009. The film was shot in India and the United States, and it was released on 26 February 2010.[10] Post-release, she revealed that Menon played a "crucial part in moulding her as an actress", teaching her how to remain natural and comfortable in front of the screen, even if she had no dialogues in a scene.[11] In the film, Samantha played the lead character Jessie, a Malayali Saint Thomas Christian girl living in Hyderabad, with whom the male protagonist, played by Naga Chaitanya, falls in love. Upon release of the film, Samantha received highly positive reviews for her portrayal, with the film itself garnering widespread critical acclaim.[12] Critics at Sify praised Samantha as a "scene-stealer" and her beauty as "alluring", adding, "she was the girl to watch out for."[12] Jeevi from Idlebrain.com, wrote that "Samantha's debut is one of the best heroine debuts in Telugu cinema" and noted that the "minute expressions she gave spoke volumes about her", whilst labelling the film as a "classic". Her performance in Ye Maaya Chesave earned her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut – South and the Nandi Special Jury Award.[13][14][15] Samantha appeared in a cameo role in the Tamil version of the film, portraying an assistant director who becomes an actress.[16] Both the Telugu and the Tamil versions of the films proved to be major successes, propelling Samantha to stardom.[17] She followed up her collaborations with Gautham Menon and A. R. Rahman by appearing in the music video for the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010 promotional song, Semmozhiyaana Thamizh Mozhiyaam, which Menon directed and Rahman composed.<br><br>
            Samantha's next release was the romantic drama, Baana Kaathadi (2010), opposite Adharvaa. The film was actually the third Tamil project signed by the actress, but its release preceded the first two that she was contracted for due to delays in their completion.[18][19] Samantha portrayed a student of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), the first such role in Tamil cinema.[20] Her next release was Ravi Varman's Moscowin Kavery (2010), originally the first film she began work on. The shooting for the film began in August 2007, with Samantha, then briefly credited with the screen name Yasodha, joining the team later in the year.[21] In an interview held in 2008, Ravi Varman mentioned that he had decided that Samantha would be the lead actress for his film within three minutes after viewing one of her commercial assignments.[22] He went on to describe her as an actress with "intelligence" and "potential", whilst drawing comparisons with the noted actress, Revathi.[22] However, due to Ravi Varman's prior commitments as cinematographer in other projects, the film languished in development hell, eventually releasing in August 2010.[23] The film earned negative reviews from critics, though Samantha's performance was credited as one of the sole highlights that the film offered.[24] In August 2008, while still completing her last three projects, Samantha also signed up to play the lead role of a modern girl in the Narain-starrer, Pookada Ravi, which was later shelved.[25][26] Samantha then went on to feature in Vamsi Paidipally's Telugu film Brindaavanam (2010) in which she played a supporting role alongside NTR Jr and Kajal Aggarwal. Her performance as Indu was well-received despite having a shorter screen time, and the film became her second successful venture in Telugu.<br><br>
            Samantha featured in the big-budget Telugu film, Dookudu (2012) alongside Mahesh Babu, which became one of the most successful Telugu films of all time.[27] The film received positive reviews, with a critic from The Times of India stating "Samantha looks beautiful and has done a great job, though her role as Prashanthi isn't too lengthy."[28] She received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for her performance in the film. She also subsequently made guest appearances in two of Gautham Vasudev Menon's films, first in the psychological thriller film, Nadunisi Naaygal (2011) as a mental asylum inmate and then repeated her role from Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa in the Hindi version of the film, Ekk Deewana Tha (2012). Her popularity in Telugu films led to Nadunisi Naaygal was dubbed and released in Telugu as Eera Gulabeelu, with Samantha featured prominently on the film's posters, despite only having a guest appearance.[29] During the period, Samantha had also been signed two big-budget projects in Tamil, Mani Ratnam's Kadal (2013) and Shankar's I (2015), but was forced to opt out from both films, since she was suffering from a skin disease and could not work for two months during mid-2012.[30][31][32] Samantha next featured in S. S. Rajamouli's live action Telugu-Tamil bilingual project Eega (2012) alongside Nani and Sudeep, portraying a micro artist who runs a NGO and takes revenge for the murder of her lover.[33] As the film featured a CGI-created housefly as the main character, Samantha noted that she had to use her imagination and act accordingly. She also revealed that many heavy lights were used for the shoot of the film and she subsequently suffered skin burns, calling the process "very stressful" but "satisfying".[34] Titled Naan Ee (2012) in Tamil, the film opened to highly positive reviews and Samantha also won high critical acclaim for her performance. A critic from The Hindu noted "Samantha blooms in the role given to her," while Jeevi of Idlebrain.com wrote her "successful run continues as she protrays the role a bereaved lover with perfection".[35][36] Sify.com also praised her performance in the film, citing her "subtle expressions of love, fear and anxiety work well for the film" and that she "looks beautiful and has performed her role with consummate ease".[37][38] The film went on to become a major commercial success, grossing more than ₹ 1.25 billion, and went on to be dubbed in several foreign and Indian languages.<br><br>
            Samantha then worked on Gautham Vasudev Menon's a trilingual romantic drama film and played the leading female role of Nithya in the Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi versions of the film, shooting scenes simultaneously back-to-back with three different actors. The Tamil version, Neethaane En Ponvasantham (2012) featured her alongside Jiiva, while Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu (2012) paired her opposite Nani. A further Hindi version titled Assi Nabbe Poorey Sau with Aditya Roy Kapoor was simultaneously shot with the other two films and was "60%" completed, before Menon shelved the venture after his other Hindi film, Ekk Deewana Tha, had failed at the box office.[42] The film spanned three periods in the life of a couple, focusing on their romantic relationship at school, college and in their late twenties. Samantha revealed that she knew Gautham would want to work with her again and immediately accepted the opportunity to portray the roles when she was offered the film. She felt that she "could relate to the attributes and the circumstances the character goes through" and described Nithya's character as "close to her."[43] To make her performance as authentic as possible, Samantha chose to dub for herself in the Tamil version of the film. The Tamil and Telugu versions of the film opened in December 2012, earning polarizing reactions. Neethane En Ponvasantham earned mixed reviews and performed averagely at the box office, though Samantha received highly critical acclaim for her portrayal. The critic from The Hindu noted she "comes up with possibly the best performance by a female lead in Tamil cinema this year" and "her transformation from a gawky teenager to an adult, unable to overcome her ego, is outstanding".[44] Meanwhile, IBN stated "Samantha's transformation from a school kid to an adult is a treat to watch," while Rediff.com noted she is "pretty, graceful, and does an excellent job of conveying the emotions of a girl in love, especially during the school sequence, while concluding she carries the film on her slender shoulders."[45][46] The Telugu version, Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu, received positive reviews and did well commercially, while Samantha's performance again received high critical acclaim. The Hindu wrote she "goes a step further from her famous portrayal of Jessie (Ye Maaya Chesaave) and brings out the intricacy of her character well", while The Times of India wrote "Samantha has the author-backed role and she creams it."[47][48] At the 60th Filmfare Awards South, she subsequently won the Best Actress awards for both the Tamil and Telugu film industries for her performances in Neethane En Ponvasantham and Eega. Samantha became the second-ever actress to achieve the feat after Revathi had secured both awards in 1993.[49] 2012 became her most prolific award-winning year and she secured further accolades for Best Actress at the Vijay Awards, Santosham Film Awards and the CineMAA Awards.<br><br>

        <h2>Commercial success and establishment in big-budget films (2013–2018)</h2>

        <br>
        <p>
            Although Samantha often portrayed strong character roles in her early films, post-2012, she has appeared increasingly in big-budget, hero-oriented films, which have comparatively smaller scope for actresses.[51] Samantha next appeared in the Telugu multi-starrer film, Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013) alongside Venkatesh and Mahesh Babu, which received positive reviews and was commercially successful. Though her role was comparatively minuscule to her co-stars, IBN Live noted it was "good to see Samantha shed her glamorous side and welcome performance-oriented roles, which she only handles with deftness and ease".[52][53] The romantic comedy Jabardasth (2013) alongside Siddharth, in which she portrayed a wedding planner, became a commercial failure, though critics noted Samantha is "getting better by the day and it's a delight to watch her on screen".[54][55] Samantha then starred alongside Pawan Kalyan in the family drama, Attarintiki Daredi (2013), which emerged as the highest-grossing Telugu film upon release. A critic from Rediff.com noted Samantha "exudes confidence even though she has limited screen time and nothing much to do", and her performance saw her win Best Actress recognition at the SIIMA Awards and the Santosham Film Awards, in addition to her fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu.[56] Her final release of 2013 was in the unsuccessful Telugu masala film Ramayya Vasthavayya, where she had a small role, with a critic noting "we have seen Samantha in better roles and better films."<br><br>
            The year 2014 saw Samantha appear in six films and make a return to the Tamil film industry. Her first release saw Samantha portray a dual role in the family drama film Manam (2014), where she featured alongside several members of the Akkineni film family. Featuring as a young mother and a college student in two different time eras, Samantha received positive reviews for her work, with the critic from Sify saying "she excels" and The Hindu's reviewer noting that she "emotes well and easily shifts between the roles."[58][59] Her performance fetched Samantha her fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu, while she won Best Actress (Critics) at the SIIMA Awards. Samantha subsequently featured alongside Naga Chaitanya again in the long-delayed Autonagar Surya (2014), before playing different minuscule roles in the Telugu action masala films Alludu Seenu (2014) and Rabhasa (2014). Critics lamented that she "signed up to be a glam doll" for the ventures. She has "previously shown us she is capable of doing much more, but of late, seems to be stuck with doing similar roles that require her to be an attractive prop."[60][61] Samantha later revealed that she solely worked on Alludu Seenu as a favor to producer Bellamkonda Suresh, who had helped her delay the making of Jabardasth during her health problems.<br><br>
            Samantha worked simultaneously on two big-budget Tamil films in early 2014, working with industry-leading actors and directors.[11] N. Lingusamy's gangster masala film Anjaan (2014) opposite Suriya, received negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office. Portraying a small role, critics panned her character in the film, stating Samantha "gamely performs the requisite crazy girl duties".[63] Her other release, AR Murugadoss's action drama Kaththi (2014) opposite Vijay won predominantly positive reviews and became the most profitable Tamil film of 2014.[citation needed] Again, reviewers criticised her character stating "all she had to do in the film is smile and look pretty," while The Hindu remarked she played "an emoticon" and "that covers her contribution to the proceedings".[64][65] She received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil for her performance in Kaththi. She subsequently featured in the Telugu film S/O Satyamurthy with Allu Arjun, as a part of another hero-oriented film, though critics noted she "enacts her part with grace" and that she "plays her role well".<br><br>
            She then featured in her second dual role as a part of Vijay Milton's road film, 10 Endrathukulla (2015), where she appeared alongside Vikram. She sported a different rural look for the role and her performance won mixed reviews, with a critic noting "Samantha doesn't make much of an impact in the film except towards the end."[68] Like Anjaan and Kaththi, critics lamented her role as a clumsy girl, with Sify.com stating "beyond a point Samantha's character is plainly annoying".[69][70] Samantha subsequently won positive reviews for her role and performance in Velraj's Thanga Magan, where she featured opposite Dhanush. Portraying a homely role of a wife for the first time in Tamil films, the actress noted it would be the first of many such performance-oriented roles, as she looked to move away from being typecast in charming characters. A critic from Sify.com labelled her performance as "impressive", while DNA.com stated Samantha "has given a very subdued and mature performance sans drama".[71][72] Likewise, a reviewer from Silverscreen, suggested that she "delivers a performance that stands head and shoulders above her work in previous films".<br><br>
            Samantha's first release of 2016 was in the Tamil romantic drama film Bangalore Naatkal, where she made a guest appearance and reprised Nithya Menen's minor role from the film's Malayalam original.[74] She then portrayed the lead female role in Atlee's Theri, and featured alongside Vijay for the second time. Her performance received positive reviews, with a critic from DNA India stating "Samantha looks pretty as always" and that "she has done an incredible job in dubbing with a range of emotions in her numerous shades – doctor, lover, mother – and she shines".[75] Likewise, Behindwoods.com stated that Theri "could be one of Samantha's best roles; she plays a doctor and has given out a soulful performance".[76] The film went on to become of the most profitable Tamil films of all time, upon release, and ended a barren spell for the actress in Tamil cinema, by becoming her first commercially successful film in Tamil cinema since Kaththi (2014).[77] Samantha then worked for a second time with director Vikram Kumar and Suriya in the critically-acclaimed fantasy film 24. Featuring as the love interest of the film's lead character, Samantha won praise from critics for her small role in the film, with Sify.com stating that the actress "does well in the comedy scenes."[78][79] The film also performed well at the box office, with The Hindu stating she was "at the top of the film industry," following her back-to-back commercial successes.[80][81] She received two nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil for her performances in Theri and 24 respectively.<br><br>
            Samantha also featured in three high-profile Telugu films during 2016; Although Srikanth Addala's family drama Brahmotsavam opposite Mahesh Babu was a box office failure, her role in Trivikram Srinivas's romantic comedy, A Aa alongside Nithiin, won her high critical acclaim and commercial success. Portraying Anasuya Ramalingam, a naive girl trying to escape from her mother's controlling behavior, Samantha received highly positive reviews for her character portrayal. A critic from The New Indian Express noted "A Aa undoubtedly is Samantha's film" and that "right from her first frame till the last, she delivers a stellar performance and shows what she can do if given ample screen time", adding that she was "a joy to watch".[82] Likewise, a reviewer from The Hindu noted "Samantha, after a long time, gets enough screen time and scope to shine", stating "she's vulnerable as a 23-year-old reeling in her mother's shadow and can also play the high maintenance, stubborn girl with ease", while concluding "this is a role she can be proud of".[83] Similarly Bollywoodlife.com noted her "earnest performance was the life and soul of the romantic comedy", while DNA India's critic cited that "Samantha and Nithiin's performances in this movie will be what people would rave about for days to come".[84][85] The film also performed well at the box office, doing excellent business for a Telugu film released in the United States.[86][87] Her performance fetched her several awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu, her second win in the category. She then featured in the commercially successful action film Janatha Garage directed by Koratala Siva, with a critic noting despite "a limited role, she gives a nice performance".[88][89] She then portrayed the lead female role in Atlee's Mersal, and featured alongside Vijay for the third time and her performance received positive reviews and the film became one of the highest grossing Tamil films of 2017 and was a blockbuster at the box office. Mersal went on to join the coveted ₹200 crore club.<br><br>
            In 2018, she starred in Rangasthalam which went on to become an all-time blockbuster of Telugu cinema, only behind Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017) and Baahubali: The Beginning (2015).[91] The Tamil action thriller Irumbu Thirai in which she starred opposite Vishal and the Telugu biographical drama Mahanati were successful at the box-office and each had a run of 100 days at the box office. Her performances in Rangasthalam and Mahanati were highly praised, and she earned her seventh Best Actress – Telugu nomination for the former and her first Best Supporting Actress – Telugu nomination for the latter at the Filmfare Awards. Mridula R from The News Minute noted her critically acclaimed film U Turn as a curiosity-generating script that provides her with the ultimate screen presence since the story begins with her and she finds it ends, rather that not being shaking a leg in Anjaan, Brindavanam, Kaththi and Attarintiki Daredi or being glam doll or having out-of-scope performances overshadowed in Dookudu, S/O Satyamurthy, Brahmotsavam, Theri and Mersal.<br><br>
