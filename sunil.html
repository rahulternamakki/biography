            Sunil Chhetri (born 3 August 1984) is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains both Indian Super League club Bengaluru and the India national team. He is known for his link-up play, goal scoring abilities, and leadership.[3][4] He is the third-highest international goalscorer among active players, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi,[5][6] fourth overall, and is also the most-capped player and the all-time top goalscorer of the India national team.<br><br>

            Sunil Chhetri was born on 3 August 1984 to K. B. Chhetri, an officer in the Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers of the Indian Army, and Sushila Chhetri in Secunderabad, India.[139][1][140][141] His father played football for the Indian Army football team while his mother and her twin sister played for the Nepal women's national team.[142] Chhetri started playing football from a young age taking part in various tournaments.<br><br>
            On 4 December 2017, Chhetri married his long time girlfriend Sonam Bhattacharya who is the daughter of former Indian international and Mohun Bagan player Subrata Bhattacharya.[144][145] Sunil Chhetri was named an 'Asian Icon' by AFC on his 34th birthday in 2018.[146] He signed a 3-year deal with global sports giant Puma starting from 2020.<br><br>
            On 27 September 2022, FIFA launched a documentary on FIFA+, of three episodes named 'Captain Fantastic', which captures a lot of what is unseen and unheard about Chhetri, be it his pre-teen anguish, his debut for India aged 20, his romance with his future wife and his early days and peak as a football player with many awards and records under his belt.<br><br>

        <h2>International career: 2007–2016</h2>

        <p>
            Chhetri's first international tournament was the 2007 Nehru Cup. In the opening game, India defeated Cambodia 6–0 with Chhetri scoring two goals.[91] He also scored a goal in the 2–3 defeat to Syria[92] and another in the 3–0 win over Kyrgyzstan[93] to take his goal tally to four. Chhetri was involved in the build-up to Pappachen Pradeep's decisive goal as India beat Syria 1–0 in the final to become the first champions of the tournament since 1997.[94] Later in 2007, India began their 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. They were knocked out in the first round by Lebanon with Chhetri scoring once in the away leg (a 4–1 defeat)[95] and once in the home leg (a 2–2 draw)[96] resulting in a 6–3 aggregate defeat.<br><br>
            The 2008 SAFF Championship started with three victories out of a possible three in the group stages. In the opening game, Chhetri scored a goal in a 4–0 victory over Nepal.[98] He scored once more in the championship—in the 2–1 semi-final victory over Bhutan; this was an equaliser before Gouramangi Singh scored India's second goal to send India through to the final.[99] India lost 1–0 to the Maldives in the final and Chhetri played for the full 90 minutes.[100] Later that year, in the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, Chhetri played in all of the matches and scored four goals. In the 1–0 win over Afghanistan, he was involved in the build-up to Climax Lawrence's goal.[101] He also played for the full 90 minutes against Tajikistan (a 1–1 draw)[102] and Turkmenistan (a 2–1 win).[103] In the semi-final against Myanmar, Chhetri scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory after being assisted by Bhaichung Bhutia to see India through to the final.[104] In the final against Tajikistan, Chhetri scored a hat-trick which enabled India to win the Cup. This automatically qualified India for the 2011 Asian Cup, the first time they had qualified for the tournament in 24 years.[105] His first goal was originally disallowed for offside by Uzbek referee Valentin Kovalenko, who changed his mind after consulting his assistant.[106] Hundreds of fans waited outside the stadium to greet India's new "poster boy" and India manager Bob Houghton stated, "He is remarkable, brave and honest. He never gives up."<br><br>
            Initially, Goal.com stated that Chhetri would miss the 2009 Nehru Cup through injury.[107] He played in the tournament, however, and he scored in the second match of the Nehru Cup, a penalty in a 2–1 win over Kyrgyzstan,[108] this being first time he had completed a full match since getting injured before the pre-season tour of Spain with his club.[109] He featured in the other three games in the round robin stage of the tournament, including the "dress rehearsal" for the final against Syria, but did not score.[110][111][112] Chhetri was one of India's scorers in the penalty shootout victory over Syria in the final after the match had ended in a 1–1 draw. He showed flashes of brilliance and scored the second goal in a 5–2 defeat at the hands of Bahrain in the 2011 Asian Cup. He also scored a goal against South Korea at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.<br><br>
            He was named the national team Captain for the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualification which took place in Malaysia. On 16 November 2011 Chhetri scored in the 39th and 53rd minute for India against Malaysia in a friendly match played at the Salt Lake Stadium. The match ended 3–2 in favour of India.[114] On 11 December 2011 after scoring a goal in SAFF Cup's final he set a new record by scoring seven goals in a single edition of the SAFF Championship surpassing I. M. Vijayan's record of six goals in the 97 edition.<br><br>
            On 22 August 2012, Chhetri scored a goal with a header in the added time of the first half against Syria in the first match of 2012 Nehru Cup where India won the match 2–1.[116] In the second match, which was on 25 August he scored two goals against Maldives, one goal coming from penalty where the team won 3–0.[117] In the final against fancied opponents Cameroon, Chhetri scored from a well-taken penalty kick to equalize the score at 2–2. In the ensuing penalty shootout which India won 5–4, Chhetri went as the second kick-taker from India and scored.<br><br>

        <h2>International career: 2017–present</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            On 11 October 2017, Chhetri scored and assisted in a 4–1 home win against Macau in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, with this win they qualified for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup after missing out in 2015.[119] Chhetri captained India to a 13 match unbeaten run before losing the final match to Kyrgyzstan. Nonetheless, not only did India qualify for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup but also managed to top their group. He was among four renowned Asian players including Ali Daei, Sun Jihai and Phil Younghusband to be chosen for the seeds for the upcoming Asian cup.<br><br>
            In June 2018, Chhetri scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win over Chinese Taipei in their first match of 2018 Intercontinental Cup.[120] However, after this match, Chhetri was disappointed with the poor turnout at the stadium and he uploaded a video on Twitter requesting people to come to Mumbai Football Arena to support the Indian team. His video went viral and garnered widespread support from fans, celebrities and legendary cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. The stadium was packed with exuberant crowd for the rest of the matches. In the second match of the tournament, which was also Chhetri's 100th international appearance for India and also scored two goals including a goal from penalty spot in a 3–0 victory over Kenya.[121] Chhetri scored a goal in the next match against New Zealand, but the match ended 2–1 loss for India though India qualified for the final.[122] On 10 June, Chhetri scored twice again in a 2–0 win over Kenya in the final to win the Intercontinental Cup title and also equalled Argentina's Lionel Messi's tally of 64 international goals, making him the joint-second active international goalscorer at that time in front of Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo.[123] He finished as the top scorer of the tournament with eight goals.[124] Chhetri's brace against Thailand on 6 January 2019 helped India to get a historic 4–1 win over them in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup.[125] On 7 June 2021, Chhetri scored twice in a 2–0 win over Bangladesh in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification.[126] On 13 October 2021, he scored twice again in a 3–1 win over Maldives in the 2021 SAFF Championship, making him the joint-sixth all time international goalscorer at that time,[127] and the third highest active international goalscorer in football, behind only to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.[128] On 16 October 2021, he scored again in a 3–0 win over Nepal in the final of the 2021 SAFF Championship, equalling Messi's 80 international goals.<br><br>
            Due to some injuries after 2021–22 Indian Super League season, Sunil was not able to participate for International friendlies against Bahrain and Belarus which were held in March 2022. Then he made his appearance against Jordan in an international friendly fixture which was played as a part of preparing for 2023 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers which was going to be held in June 2022.<br><br>
            On 8 June 2022, Chhetri played against Cambodia in 2023 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers where he scored a brace, from a penalty spot and a header from a cross from Brandon Fernandes, by which India won 2–0 in Salt Lake Stadium.[130] In the next match against Afghanistan, he scored from a freekick taking his international goals tally to 83. India won 2–1 in the match. Chhetri scored his 84th goal against Hong Kong in a 4–0 win in the next match.[131][132] India qualified for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup with Chettri becoming the top scorer in the third round of the qualifiers with 4 goals.<br><br>
            On 28 March, Chhetri scored his 85th goal against Kyrgyzstan in the tri-nation friendly and overtook Ferenc Puskás to become the fifth-highest international goalscorer.[134] On 18 June, Chhetri scored the opening goal of a 2–0 win over Lebanon in the final of the 2023 Hero Intercontinental Cup, thus contributing decisively to help India win the tournament.[135] Chhetri was the joint-top scorer of the tournament with two goals alongside fellow teammate Lallianzuala Chhangte.[136] On 21 June, Chhetri scored his 4th hat-trick for India in a 4–0 win over Pakistan in a group stage match of the 2023 SAFF Championship.[137] His third goal of the night was his 90th international goal, thus overtaking Mokhtar Dahari's tally of 89 goals to become the second-highest Asian goalscorer in international football only behind Ali Daei of Iran, and the third among active players after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>

        <h2>Style of play</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            Sunil, generally, plays as a left winger in his club football to help and supply his foreign centre forward. But for national team, he generally plays as a centre forward which helped him to act as a finisher and also to score 92 goals from 140 Appearances for his national team with a better goals per game ratio than his club football career. Chhetri's style of play increasingly features elements identical to Kom's trademark never-quit commitment and sheer grit. Where he was once all spark plug and no gears, now it's watchful cruise control, but without concession on any scoring opportunity. In his entertaining From Delhi To The Den (written along with Owen Amos), the former India manager Stephen Constantine says this "hard-working striker with superb technique" is crucial to team spirit because he embodies fearlessness. You can see it in the goals he racks up, one after another: the astonishing 80-yard run foxing seven separate defenders to score against Kyrgyzstan, the imperious chip over Kenya's outclassed goalkeeper, the edges, parries and headers piled up relentlessly to break every Indian record.<br><br>
            "Chhetri is in a category all by himself", says Marcus Mergulhao, Goan sports journalist of The Times of India, who is himself one of Indian football's most respected institutions. He told me, "As a player, he has made youngsters fall in love with the game. As a person, he has made the media take note. He is the face and voice of Indian football, who has inspired a generation and given us hope. What's more, he's playing his very best at the moment. The last three years have been phenomenal. The ultimate gift the current crop of footballers can give back to him is take India among the top ten in Asia, and play against the top teams on a regular basis. Chhetri would be pleased with that."<br><br>
            Mergulhao says the superstar "is a different player and an extremely different person from the one that I had coffee with for the first time in the summer of 2009. It is his stints abroad that changed everything – at the Sporting Kansas City in the United States and later with Sporting CP in Portugal. Those experiences opened his eyes to another, more professional approach, more efficient ways of training, and probably showed him just how much ground he needed to cover. He didn't get to play very much, but by the time he returned he was clearly transformed, and you could see on the field that he was clearly a cut above the rest." While still with Sporting CP, Chhetri was lent to the Goa team Churchill Brothers FC Goa, and Mergulhao recalls one crucial game when "with just a few minutes left, Chhetri stepped up and scored from a free kick so effortlessly that you could tell this man had astounding self-belief. The Brazilian star Roberto Mendes da Silva Beto was also in that side and the regular free kick taker, but Chhetri knew what he was doing, showing incredible poise and confidence. You have to remember that in the first ten years of his career, this player did not win any league title, then in the next seven years, he won four. That's how you understand Chhetri as a footballer, and the influence he has over Indian football." Sunil also likes to score by dribbling the defenders with his fake touches and also from long rangers like how he did against some teams like Johor Darul Ta'zim in 2016 AFC Cup.<br><br>
